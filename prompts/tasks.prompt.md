Before you start, record the current time in `TIME.md`.

Use the `time` tool after every step to check how long you have been working.

---

Analyze `PROMPT.md` and create a numbered, nested checklist of tasks to be done based on the prompt.

Place the checklist in `TASKS.md`.

Spend time understanding the prompt, reviewing the software documentation, researching the objective, and planning the implementation.

Continue to review and refine the checklist until you are confident it covers all necessary steps to complete the task.

Do not stop until you have spent at least 5 minutes reviewing and refining the checklist.
