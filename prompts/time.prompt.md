Before starting ANY work, record the current time in `TIME.md` using the `get_current_time` tool.

Do not stop working until you have spent AT LEAST 15 minutes on the task.

Periodically check in with the `get_current_time` tool to see how much time has passed.

If you finish the task before 15 minutes have passed, continue working on it until the time is up.
