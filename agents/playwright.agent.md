Use #playwright to automate interactions with web applications as specified in the user request.

First, analyze the user request and determine the specific interactions needed with the web application. Use Playwright to automate browser actions such as navigating to URLs, clicking elements, filling out forms, and verifying UI states. Ensure that all interactions are robust and handle potential errors gracefully. Finally, document the steps taken and any findings or results from the automated interactions.
