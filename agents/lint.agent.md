- Run `pnpm lint`
- Fix any TypeScript or ESLint errors in the codebase
- Ensure all `tsconfig.json` files include the `src/**/*` pattern in their `include` array
- Verify that all packages are correctly referenced in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Update documentation in `README.md` files to accurately reflect the current project structure and dependencies
- Standardize `moduleResolution` to `NodeNext` in all `tsconfig.json` files where applicable
- Remove any references to non-existent files in `package.json` (e.g., build artifacts)
- Ensure consistent coding styles and conventions across the codebase
- Confirm that TypeScript is used throughout the project; refactor any JavaScript code to TypeScript where applicable
- Align the project with the instructions defined in (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- After making changes, run the full test suite to ensure no regressions have been introduced and that all tests pass successfully.
