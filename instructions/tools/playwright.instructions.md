# Playwright MCP Validation Instructions

- The model MUST always use the Playwright MCP to validate any design or style changes.
- Playwright MCP validation is required before, during, and after any modification to CSS, component styles, or layout.
- Do not skip or bypass Playwright MCP validation under any circumstances.
- All design and style changes must be tested for visual and functional correctness using the Playwright MCP.
- If unsure whether a change affects design or style, default to using the Playwright MCP.
- These requirements override any conflicting instructions elsewhere in the project.
